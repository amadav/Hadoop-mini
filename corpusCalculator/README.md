The program calculates and finds the top three sentences in the corpus on basis of probabilities of each of the sentence. The program is divided into three map-reduce jobs each contributing to find the top 3 sentences. Distributed cache has been used for reading the file for the last phase.
Requirements for the program to run correctly.

****IMPORTANT****
--->>> The program has been hardcoded to read the distributed cache files' local path for the corpus file from the location '/opt/corpus.txt'. The file should be named as â€˜corpus.txt and in the normal file format with all permissions given.

Please find the EMR report for the codebase test on cluster environment.
