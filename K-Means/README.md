The program inputs its parameters of the form --

--input file> input table name> center table name> K points>

In	the	assignment,	you	are	to	firstly	create	a	schema	within	Hbase	to	store	the	data,	and	then	
implement clustering algorithm	that	can	cluster	dataset	into	k	groups	by	using	the	map	and	
reduce	primitives.	You	are	open	to	choose	the	algorithm	you	like,	but	you	need	to	considering	
the	feasibility	and	complexity	of	the	work.

The	dataset	is	from	UCI	machine	learning	repository.	Basically,	it	is	collected	to	analysis	the	
energy	efficiency	of	building	with	different	shapes.	There	are	totally	768	data	points,	and	each	
of	these	points	has	8	features	and	2	responses.
